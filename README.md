##jarvis mini - my personal AI assistant  

a personal mini project to build a powered voice assistant in Python.
Inspired by Jarvis from the Iron man movies but built by scratch from me.

---

Why am i building this?
JARVIS is not just a random coding project 
i am developing it to-
- develop my coding skills
- help me explore TTS and STT modules
- Learn how to build something from scratch
- Build a tool to scratch my own back
- create a devlog series and document the full journey

## Features i am working on in this mini project:

||status|features||
--------------------
|| ⬜  | Takes voice command using 'SPEECH RECOGNITION'
|| ⬜  | Text to speech using 'pytts3x'

|| ⬜  | Modular Command system
|| ⬜  | API integration (news,weather,wiki,etc)

 This project will be recorded in certain devlogs where i record whatever code i write what failures i go through and what my updates are
 "Build iin public, fail in public, learn in public" is gonna be my moto 

 Check out the full series as i build my project:
 [devlog playlist coming soon]()

 you can expect:
  - daily project updates
  - challenges i face
  - real time bug fixing
